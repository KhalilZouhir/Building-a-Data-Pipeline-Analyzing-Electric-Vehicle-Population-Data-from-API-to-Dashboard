	Notes		{4}
1. 	:	A Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) is an all-electric vehicle using one or more batteries to store the electrical energy that powers the motor and is charged by plugging the vehicle in to an electric power source. A Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) is a vehicle that uses one or more batteries to power an electric motor; uses another fuel, such as gasoline or diesel, to power an internal combustion engine or other propulsion source; and is charged by plugging the vehicle in to an electric power source.
2. 	:	Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility is based on the fuel requirement and electric-only range requirement as outlined in RCW 82.08.809 and RCW 82.12.809 to be eligible for Alternative Fuel Vehicles retail sales and Washington State use tax exemptions.  Sales or leases of these vehicles must occur on or after 8/1/2019 and meet the purchase price requirements to be eligible for Alternative Fuel Vehicles retail sales and Washington State use tax exemptions.
3. 	:	Monthly count of vehicles for a county may change from this report and prior reports. Processes were implemented to more accurately assign county at the time of registration.
4. 	:	Electric Range is no longer maintained for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) because new BEVs have an electric range of 30 miles or more. Zero (0) will be entered where the electric range has not been researched.
