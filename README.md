# Building-a-Data-Pipeline-Analyzing-Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data-from-API-to-Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive data pipeline to process electric vehicle population data from API to dashboard. The pipeline consists of the following steps:

- Data Scraping: A VM scrapes the dataset from a public API.
- Data Storage: The data is stored in an SFTP server deployed using Docker on another VM.
- Data Collection: Data files are collected using a physical machine.
- ETL Process: The data is processed with Talend for Extract, Transform, Load (ETL).
- Data Warehouse: The processed data is loaded into a Snowflake data warehouse.
- Data Analysis: Analysis is performed on the data within the data warehouse.
- Dashboard Visualization: A Power BI dashboard is created to visualize the data.
